<p>La Villa Rose was upgraded recently.<p>

<p>Let's start with the nicest improvement: we now have a salt water pool!<p>

<p>In addition, the outside lighting was improved, the path is now very well lit, when you come back at night the door is now in the light, which is much easier with the keys, there is an additional light on the side for evening barbecues and a second additional light on the other side by the pool. </p>

<p>The couch was changed. In the kitchen there is a new electric stove and a new oven </a></p>

<p>Three bedrooms were repainted.</a></p>

<p>Finally, the garden was redesigned, the multipliant palm trees next to the pool were replaced by flowers. </a></p>
