There are a few bars and restaurants that will allow the less courageous guests to drink without waiting during the three minutes that it takes to come back to La Villa Rose. There a pier on the beach, and you can take the shuttle to Fort-de-France from this pier. There is a departure every 30 minutes. <br>However, Martinique is not just L'Anse-à-L'Âne. Thank to its very central position in the island, you can very easily go to the beautiful beaches in the South, starting with the most famous, Les Salines. <br>You can also go to the north, in the rain forest, in the Garden of Balata. You can also go to the beautiful beaches of the Caribean coast, with the spectacular beach at l'Anse de la Couleuvre.
